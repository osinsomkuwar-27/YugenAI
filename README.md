Problem Statement ID: SBM02 – Social Booster Media Domain
Xenia Hackathon 2026

📌 Overview

Cold outreach remains one of the most widely used strategies for connecting with customers, partners, and talent. However, most outreach today is generic, poorly personalized, tone-mismatched, and heavily dependent on cloud-based AI services — raising concerns around privacy, cost, and scalability.

YūgenAI is a privacy-first, fully offline LLM-powered outreach engine that generates hyper-personalized, tone-adaptive, multi-channel cold messages using structured persona intelligence — without relying on external AI APIs.

🎯 Problem Statement

Design and build an offline cold outreach automation system that:

1. Runs entirely on a locally hosted LLM

2. Generates multi-channel personalized outreach

3. Adapts tone based on recipient communication style

4. Stores and reuses previous outreach intelligence

5. Operates without any external AI API dependency

💡 Our Solution

Uses a fully offline LLM (via Ollama)

It Generates:

📧 Cold Email

💬 WhatsApp Message
